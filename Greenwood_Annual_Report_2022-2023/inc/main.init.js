From the moment we explored the school, we knew it was a special placeand the right place for her to learn and thrive for her middle school and high school years.Two decades and two Bowman Greenwood grads later, the school has now celebrated its 20th Anniversary; it has grown in terms of its physical size and its reputation in the Ontario independent school community; and while many faces in the classrooms and hallways are different, one thing has stayed the same: the strength of the amazing Greenwood community.Since it was founded, Greenwood students, parents\/guardians, staff and past staff, alumni, friends and grandfriends have formed a wonderful network of support that has worked to build character and help prepare our students for life after Greenwood. When you look around the school, you see the futurethe future of education, the latest cutting-edge technology, aspiring CEOs, actors, scientists, lawyers and more. None of that would be possible without the communitys support. In addition to updates regarding Greenwoods financials and strategic priorities, we are pleased to highlight in this report a few people who contribute to the Greenwood community. Of course there are so many more who give of their time, talent and their financial support. We thank all of you for helping to make Greenwood the wonderful school that it is.

Our 20212026 strategic plan continues to guide us and keeps our focus sharp on what matters most to our students, past and present. The results of our student engagement survey show us that Greenwood students feel supported and benefit from our focus on mental health and well-being, diversity, equity, and inclusion, experiential learning, and technology integration. The campus expansion is well underway withphase one of the demolition complete (RIP KFC, as the students say).While perhaps predictably the campus expansion is taking longer thanwe would like or anticipated, it is coming along and will be a welcome addition to our Greenwood community and student experience. We have made clear strides towards the goals outlined in our 202126 strategic plan. You can read about these on the next pages. You will also hear about some of the generous Greenwood community members who give their time and financial support. I extend gratitude to all of our stakeholders for this ongoing support, and look forward to the continued growth and success of our school community.Its difficult to sum up how much I respect this school. I have enjoyed immensely getting to know the Greenwood community and watching our students blossom. It has been a privilege and an honour to serve as Greenwoods third Principal.

I can see the joy that the program brings to her.Ms. Hibbert began volunteering with Greenwoods Reading Buddies program in September 2023. Each week, Ms. Hibbert walks with the Grade 7s and 8s from Greenwood to nearby Davisville Public School to read with students in kindergarten.I really look forward to it, she said. Some mornings, its dark or rainy or freezing cold. But its great to chat with the Greenwood students on the way over and as soon as we arrive, its so worth it. Its sometimes difficult to gather everyone up to leave at the end of the program; they are so engaged in the book they are reading with their buddy.Ms. Hibbert has volunteered through school programs since her son Caleb 24 was in kindergarten. When Caleb started at Greenwood in his Grade 7 year, she knew she wanted to get involved in the Service Learning Program. I started out making sandwiches for the Youth Without Shelter program, Ms. Hibbert recalled. I didnt grow up with much. As I prepared the food each week, Id think about the person who would receive it and what that would mean to them. We are so blessed and privileged and its important to give back to others.Greenwood Annual Report 2022\/2023 10'","11":"b'Greenwoods service learning program builds character, community and relationships, she said. The schools emphasis on the whole student and character values was one of the factors that drew the family to Greenwood. And, Ms. Hibbert added, its vital to her that adults model the character values that Greenwood aims to instil in its students. Its important that we dont just say, Its important for you to give back, she said. We should all demonstrate it.Caleb is now following in his moms footsteps in giving back to the community; in December 2023, he organized a toy drive, collecting 287 new toys for the Toronto Cares Foundation.He told some family and friends, Please dont give me a present. Give a gift to the toy drive instead, Ms. Hibbert recalled proudly.In addition to service learning, Ms. Hibbert volunteers as a Parent Ambassador. Prospective families can reach out to her with questions or to hear more about her Greenwood experience. Ms. Hibbert and her husband Kevin are also major financial donors to the school.We really believe in this school, she said. And I get joy and gratification from giving back. Its hard to put into words the fulfilment I get through volunteering and through watching the students foster a love of giving back, too.I ts important thatwe dont just say,Its important foryou to give back, she said.

And I felt comfortable, too, the moment I walked in.Mr. Jungreis recalled that when he was looking for schools for daughter Mia, he wanted to find a school that had a clear focus on both academics and emotional development.Greenwood really stood out as being dedicated to developing resiliency, community and character as well as focusing on academics, he said.It was evident that they were looking at the whole person.Mr. Jungreis said Mia, who graduated in 2022 and is now studying design in Milan, Italy, loved her time at Greenwood. That piqued the interestof her brother Yonatan, who then started Greenwood in Grade 9 and will graduate next year.From the arts to business to outdoor education trips, its been such a positive experience, Mr. Jungreis said. And thats why I give back to Greenwood.Since 2016, Mr. Jungreis has pledged his support of Greenwood bymaking an annual leadership gift. He says giving to Greenwood was an easy decision.I wanted to help the school that was helping my children, said Mr. Jungreis, who has now generously donated more than $100,000 to Greenwood and is recognized as a member of the Wernham-West Society. I want the school to have what it needs to continually improve.His gifts go toward the Greenwood Fund, which supports the greatest needs of the school, as determined by the principal.My hope is that this helps Greenwood continue its momentum,Mr. Jungreis said. And in 20 years, when my kids are long graduated and into their careers, this relatively young school will have further solidifiedits reputation as an incredible place that helps students grow. People will hear Greenwood and know.Greenwood Annual Report 2022\/2023 12'","13":"b'ALUMNI GIVING: ALLIE HAWKEY Its hard to believe its been 20 years since Allie Hawkey first walked the halls of Greenwood.Now a Wealth Associate and new mom, Allie says she remains proud to be part of the Greenwood community.My time at Greenwood was a formative experience, she said. I learned to push myself and to try new things. I learned who I am at Greenwood and made special connections with so many people; Im so grateful for my time at Greenwood.Its why Allie continues to give back to Greenwood. She has served on Greenwoods Board of Directors since 2021. She has also been a member of the Greenwood Alumni Executive and on the Greenwood Foundation Board. She has also returned to speak to students many times and continues to give to Greenwood during the Annual Appeal.I stay involved because I feel passionate about the future generations of Greenwood students, she said. I believe so firmly in the core mission of the schoolto push students academically while also building character and moral values. I want to invest in that futurethrough both my time and my financial support.By giving to her Class Fund, Allie supports the Greenwood College School Foundation, and its endowment fund. A percentage of the endowment fund is disbursed each year to support the student experience. As the endowment grows, it generates returns and more funds go back to support student needs. Thats why I give to my Class Fundit means I am contributing for years to come.Allie says Greenwoods first 20 years clearly demonstrated the strength of its mission while also constantly adapting to meet the changing needs of students. The school is 20 years older, a little bit bigger and to me, 20 years better, she said. The beauty of Greenwood is that each students experience is unique and personal and I hope we can provide that same personalized experience for future Greenwood students.The evolution of the school has been so positive and I feel so lucky to have been a part of it.Greenwood Annual Report 2022\/2023 13'","14":"b'WHY I GIVE:WILLIAM FARBSTEIN For William Farbstein, Greenwood is like home.My first full-time teaching job was here at Greenwood, he said.

Hes been an adviser and coach (volleyball, tennis, baseball, among other sports) and he now holds roles in both Admissions and as Department Head of Innovation and Technology. He continues to teach tech design classes and coach the defending champions senior boys slow-pitch team.Theres so much to love about Greenwood, he said.I really appreciate the hands-on approach to learning, he said. In the Innovation Lab, we arent just sitting at computers; we are up doing things, creating things and bringing projects to fruition.The best part, he added, is seeing the pride on students faces when they create something they are proud of in the labwhen an idea in their own mind is now something they are holding in their hands. Its such an honour to help in that process and to witness that moment,he said. Mr. Farbstein says its also been an honour to see Greenwood grow rightalong with him over the past 14 years.

Ive seen the expansion of the school campus, the development of new programs and diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, and now the recreation space development is underway.A lot of that would not be possible without the generosity of Greenwoods donor community, he added.Each year for more than a decade, Mr. Farbstein himself has participated in the Staff Giving Campaign of the Annual Appeal. Each year, Greenwood staff are invited to provide a one-time monetary gift or sign up for the monthly giving program. This year, more than 40 per cent of staff have already donated. When staffwho already give of their expertise and timealso support the school with a monetary gift, it really demonstrates their commitment, Mr. Farbstein said.I believe in Greenwood, he said.
